What is this funky word SciKu you ask? SciKu is a form of poetry following the essence and style of Haiku. According to the SciKu Project, it is a morpheme created by merging science and Haiku, the traditional Japanese poetry style. 

Haiku consists of 17 syllables split in the between 3 phrases of 5 syllables, 7 syllables and 5 syllables. Many scientists are taking up to Sciku as form of science communication. Several professional scientific societies even host competitions or have sciku abstracts for their annual meetings. 

Here is my little sciku about the exciting work I do in my lab. I hope you all will like it!
